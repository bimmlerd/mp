# TODO

- Total weight we're pushing/I have to setup (per event)
- User page, profile-like
    + statistics
    + maybe add profile pics?
- Maybe event types, such as Superkondi vs Muscle Pump -> no weights im superkondi
- Automatic event creation via some asvz api or some rule
- Notifications (and subsequently subscribtions?)
- Private/Public events, groups
- FIX event creation, so that it's not only hidden from view, but not possible as a not-creator
